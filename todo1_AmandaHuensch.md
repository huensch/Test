1. (a) "Knowing the textbook is not always as helpful as knowing where to look in the textbook" - I wouldn't say this idea surprised me, per se, but I would say that while I accept this idea, I don't really know how to put it into practice. What I mean is, sure, this is good advice, but what is an actual way to put it into practice? If I take a note about it, I still have to find the note :)
 (b) two concrete strategies I will take in order to succeed in DS: plan to have the reading done 24 hours in advance so that if I'm late, I still have time to complete them. the second is to look over my notes from 2010 as a refresher.
2. Muddiest point - I never knew about the Alt + Shift + K! That's helpful. Mostly this was review, so I'm not sure I have too much muddiness at the moment. However, what is missing/muddy are the specific skills I lost from not using R and markdown for a while (the process of setting up a new markdown file; shortcuts for things like inserting <-). I really liked the suggestion of having a template saved to use for notes and such.
